# PyQA Contributor Code of Conduct

## Purpose

PyQA is a professional, open source project stewarded by Blackcat Informatics® Inc. Our goal is to build great tooling together. We expect everyone who participates to help maintain a respectful, collaborative environment focused on technical excellence.

## Expectations

We ask contributors to:

- **Stay technical.** Keep discussions centred on code, design choices, documentation, and tooling.
- **Be respectful.** Critique ideas, never people. Personal attacks, harassment, or bullying will not be tolerated.
- **Assume good intent.** Communication styles vary. Seek clarification before escalating disagreements.
- **Be constructive.** Offer actionable feedback and recognise great work when you see it.
- **Mind the space.** Keep conversations on-topic and move lengthy debates to appropriate channels.

## Unacceptable Behaviour

The following is not acceptable in any PyQA space (issues, pull requests, discussions, chats, events):

- Harassment, discrimination, or threats of violence
- Sustained disruption that derails collaboration
- Publishing private information without consent
- Coordinated bad-faith participation (trolling, sealioning, etc.)

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warnings, request to disengage, or project bans. Decisions are final. Patterns of problematic behaviour will be addressed even if individual incidents seem minor.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct:

- Email **conduct@blackcat.ca** (maintained by the PyQA core team)
- Provide links, context, and, if possible, the impact on the project
- Reports are confidential and will receive an acknowledgement within two business days

## Attribution

This policy is adapted from common open source codes of conduct and tailored for the PyQA project. Thank you for helping us keep the community professional and welcoming.
