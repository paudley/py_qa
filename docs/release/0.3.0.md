# PyQA 0.3.0 – Provenance + Distribution Rename

## Highlights

* Renamed the published distribution from `py_qa` to `pyqa_lint` to avoid the
  existing namespace collision on PyPI. The import namespace remains `pyqa`, so
  existing code can continue to `import pyqa` after installing the new package.
* Added `--explain-tools-json` to the CLI so explain mode can emit structured
  JSON (or `stdout`) for machine consumption and tests now verify the structured
  output.

## Supply Chain & Release Pipeline

* Added `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds the sdist/wheel with `uv`,
  generates a GitHub attestation (`actions/attest-build-provenance@v1`), and
  publishes to PyPI using OIDC attestations via
  `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1`. Create a `v0.3.0` tag (and future
  `v*` tags) to trigger the release workflow.
* The workflow expects a `PYPI_API_TOKEN` repository secret with publishing
  rights to `pyqa_lint`.

## Migration Notes

* Update consumer documentation to install the renamed package:

  ```bash
  pip install pyqa_lint
  ```

* No namespace changes are required—users still `import pyqa` and the CLI entry
  point remains `pyqa`.
